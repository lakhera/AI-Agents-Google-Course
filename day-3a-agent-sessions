We are seeing faster identification of targets, the design of novel drug candidates, and a more efficient path towards bringing new therapies to patients. The pace of innovation is accelerating, making drug discovery one of the most dynamic areas of AI in healthcare.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Generative AI for Molecule Design**. This is a truly groundbreaking area within drug discovery right now.\n\nLet me elaborate on what it means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n\nAt its core, generative AI, in this context, refers to machine learning models that can **create new data** that resembles a training dataset. When applied to drug discovery, this means these models can **generate novel molecular structures**.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery:** Often involves screening vast libraries of existing chemical compounds to find ones that might bind to a specific target protein. It's like searching for a key that already exists.\n*   **Generative AI Drug Discovery:** Is like having an AI architect that can design and create an entirely *new* key, perfectly shaped to fit a specific lock (the disease target), even if no such key has ever existed before.\n\n**How Does it Work (Simplified)?**\n\n1.  **Training Data:** The AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules. This data includes information about their chemical structures, their properties (like solubility, toxicity, binding affinity), and how they interact with biological targets.\n2.  **Learning Patterns:** The AI learns the underlying rules and patterns that govern molecular structure and function. It understands what makes a molecule stable, what makes it likely to bind to a protein, and what makes it potentially toxic.\n3.  **Generating New Molecules:** Based on this learned knowledge, the AI can then be \"prompted\" to generate new molecular structures. This prompting usually involves specifying desired properties, such as:\n    *   **Target Binding:** \"Design a molecule that strongly binds to protein X.\"\n    *   **Drug-likeness:** \"Create a molecule that is orally bioavailable and has low toxicity.\"\n    *   **Specific Chemical Properties:** \"Generate molecules with a certain functional group that are also stable.\"\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** The process is often iterative. The AI generates a candidate molecule, its properties are evaluated (either computationally or experimentally), and this feedback is used to refine the AI's generation process to produce even better candidates.\n\n**Why is it So Significant?**\n\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** Generative AI can design and propose potential drug candidates much faster than traditional manual or combinatorial approaches. This significantly shortens the early stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Exploring Uncharted Chemical Space:** It allows researchers to explore chemical structures that might never have been conceived of through human intuition or by simply modifying existing molecules. This opens up possibilities for treating diseases that have been difficult to address with current drugs.\n*   **Designing for Specificity and Efficacy:** By carefully defining desired properties, researchers can guide the AI to design molecules that are highly specific to their intended target, potentially leading to more effective treatments with fewer off-target side effects.\n*   **Overcoming Limitations of Existing Drugs:** For diseases where existing treatments have limitations (e.g., resistance, toxicity), generative AI can be used to design entirely new classes of drugs with improved profiles.\n*   **Reduced Costs:** By identifying promising candidates more efficiently, generative AI can help reduce the overall cost of drug discovery, which is notoriously expensive.\n\n**Examples and Real-World Impact:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** As mentioned, they are a prominent example, using generative AI for *de novo* drug design and achieving rapid progression of candidates into clinical trials.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** While they use a broader AI platform, generative approaches are part of their strategy to identify new drug targets and therapies.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, which often involves generating or identifying molecules that fit specific binding sites.\n*   **Numerous other startups and major pharmaceutical companies** are investing heavily in this technology, either through internal development or partnerships.\n\n**In essence, generative AI for molecule design is moving drug discovery from a process of searching and modifying to one of intelligent creation and design. It's a paradigm shift that holds immense promise for developing the next generation of life-saving medicines.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in generative AI for molecule design is dynamic and growing rapidly.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
